What is HTML?
-Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.

Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items

Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format

Language: a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.

HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.

In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a human body.

    - HTML is the skeleton,
    - CSS is the skin,
    - and JavaScript is the circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems that brings the structure and the skin to         life.
